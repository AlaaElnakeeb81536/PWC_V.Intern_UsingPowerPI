## PwC Power-BI in Data Analytics Project
The virtual PowerBI Case experience is an excellant starting point for a Data Analyst looking to build a career with Power BI.
This experince consists of three case studies on three different datasets. 
The real world datasets help you understand the business scenarios and steps to solve the business problems.

## Call Centre Trends
This case study deals with the Call Centre Trends. Here, we analyze the number of incoming calls,
call agent's performance, speed of answer, call duration, trends on daily and hourly basis and customer satisfaction ratings. 
The dashboard defines key KPIs that impact the customer satisfaction as well as performance of the call agents. 
The goal is to identify opprtunities where the performance can be monitored and enhanced.

## Customer Retention Dashboard
The organisation is keen to know the possible customers who are likely to churn. 
In this Dashboard, we create KPIs around demographics, company service and customer profiling to know which of them have the highest
chance of getting churned. The analysis depicts some key insights that will help the board member take steps in future to reduce the churning rate and increase customer loyalty.

## HR Analytics - Diversity and Inclusivity
Here, we create a dashboard on the employee participation in the organisation. We define the key KPIs like, New Hires, Promotions,
Employee Exits and Employee Gender ratio to understand the situation of diversity and inclusivity in the workforce. Enabling diversity 
and eliminating gender-based stereotyping is key to the balanced workforce and company success.
